# TODO

-   Rename count variable to new_pages so it's clear what we're doing
-   Cleanup code
-   Rename epub argument to book
-   Update help to describe what it does and that book can be epub or pdf
-   Update the README with more info on what it does & how it works
-   Create default config.toml if not found & remove from git
-   Convert the short arguments to the full ones in the os.system call
-   Send a message (Pick a new book!) & exit if first page > last available page
-   Cleanup the intermediate documents (pdf if epub, pngs always) when done with book
